INSURANCE QUOTE ENGINE SYSTEM
-----------------------------

The purpose of this project is to design a dynamic insurance quote engine system that calculates insurance premiums based on an applicant's age. Using C++ object-oriented programming, the system introduces structs to store applicant and age-based bracket information. An abstract class QuoteEngine provides a common interface for calculating premiums, with two derived classes (BasicQuoteEngine and PremiumQuoteEngine) implementing specific pricing strategies. The project demonstrates key concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic memory management. Users can interact with the system via a menu to add, remove, or list age brackets and compute premiums. Pointer arithmetic is used to efficiently search for matching age ranges. The result is a flexible and modular system that mimics real-world insurance logic. It serves as a practical application of advanced C++ principles in solving real business problems

ASSIGNED TASK
-------------
For this project, I was assigned to create a C++ program that calculates insurance premiums based on a person's age and vehicle information. I started by defining two structures: one called Applicant to store details like VIN, age, and vehicle type, and another called Bracket to hold the premium rates based on age ranges. I used dynamic memory to manage the brackets. Then, I created an abstract class called QuoteEngine with a virtual calculate() function. From that, I made two classes: BasicQuoteEngine for normal premiums and PremiumQuoteEngine for 1.5Ã— premiums. This helped me apply inheritance and polymorphism. I also used pointer arithmetic to scan through the bracket array efficiently. Finally, I added menu options so the user can add, remove, or list brackets and calculate premiums easily.

HOW IT WAS WORKED
------------------
To complete this project, I started by creating two structures: one for the applicant's details and another for storing premium brackets based on age. I then built an abstract base class called QuoteEngine to serve as the main interface for calculating premiums. Inside this class, I included functions to add, remove, and list premium brackets dynamically using memory allocation. After that, I created two derived classes: BasicQuoteEngine, which returns the normal premium, and PremiumQuoteEngine, which multiplies the premium by 1.5. Both classes override the calculate() function, demonstrating the use of inheritance and polymorphism. I used pointer arithmetic to loop through the bracket array for efficient matching based on age. Finally, I implemented a menu system so the user can interact with the program by adding or removing brackets and calculating premiums for any applicant entered. The program was tested and successfully gave correct outputs based on user inputs.
